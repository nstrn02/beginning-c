// Exercise 2-4. Write a program that prompts for the userâ€™s weekly pay in dollars and the hours worked 
//to be entered through the keyboard as floating-point values. The program should then calculate and 
//output the average pay per hour in the following form:
//"Your average hourly pay rate is 7 dollars and 54 cents."
